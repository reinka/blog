I'm a Systems Engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS) with strong interests in distributed systems, 
Linux internals (syscalls, namespaces & cgroups) and low-level networking (TCP/IP stack). I joined AWS in October 2024.

I hold a Statistics MSc degree with specialization in Deep Reinforcement Learning
and the mathematics of Machine Learning. I wrote my master thesis at the [Bosch
Research Center](https://www.bosch.de/en/our-company/bosch-in-germany/renningen/) 
near Stuttgart where I was working on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Imitation 
Learning algorithms for partially automated driving.

In my free time recently, I've been diving deeper into system performance, focusing on what it takes to build and maintain high-throughput, low-latency applications. My main interest is in the monitoring and performance tuning aspects of such systems. To that end, I'm currently learning about kernel-bypassing, low-level profiling techniques, and how hardware realities like CPU caches and memory access patterns dictate the performance envelope.

The purpose of this blog is to serve as a reference for my future self. And hopefully, someone else will find something useful here.

Note: I also have another, deprecated blog where I used to write: [https://www.apoehlmann.com](https://www.apoehlmann.com)
