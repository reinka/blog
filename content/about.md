~~I am a research engineer for urban autonomous driving at Mercedes-Benz AG in Stuttgart
with main focus on Continous Integration, Continous Delivery and Automated Testing.~~

I am a Cloud Engineer at SAP, working with Kubernetes on distributed systems.

I hold a Statistics MSc degree with specialization in Deep Reinforcement Learning
and the mathematics of Machine Learning. I wrote my master thesis at the [Bosch
Research Center](https://www.bosch.de/en/our-company/bosch-in-germany/renningen/) 
near Stuttgart where I was working on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Imitation 
Learning algorithms for partially automated driving.

I am also interested in [doing good better](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/doing-good-better/): 
together with three friends I co-founded the university group [Effective Altruism Magdeburg](https://www.facebook.com/eamagdeburg/)
where we promoted the ideas and philosophy behind effective altruism.

The purpose of this blog is to serve as a reference for my future self. And hopefully, someone else will find something useful here.

Note: I also have another, deprecated blog where I used to write before I created this new one: [https://www.apoehlmann.com](https://www.apoehlmann.com)
