~~I am a research engineer for urban autonomous driving at Mercedes-Benz AG in Stuttgart
with main focus on Continous Integration, Continous Delivery and Automated Testing.~~

I am a Cloud Engineer at SAP working with Kubernetes on distributed systems (more specifically 
on the SAP BTP, ABAP environement. Yeah, it's quite a tongue-twister. That's why it's also called Steampunk). 
I joined SAP in June 2021.

I hold a Statistics MSc degree with specialization in Deep Reinforcement Learning
and the mathematics of Machine Learning. I wrote my master thesis at the [Bosch
Research Center](https://www.bosch.de/en/our-company/bosch-in-germany/renningen/) 
near Stuttgart where I was working on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Imitation 
Learning algorithms for partially automated driving.

I am also interested in [doing good better](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/doing-good-better/): 
together with three friends I co-founded the university group [Effective Altruism Magdeburg](https://www.facebook.com/eamagdeburg/)
where we promoted the ideas and philosophy behind effective altruism (EA). More precisely, my EA interests focus on [longtermism](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/longtermism) ever
since reading [Yudkowsky's sequences](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/sequences) and 
Nick Bostrom's [Superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies) 
back in 2014. If you're interested in finding out more about why the 
[AI alignment problem](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn/clarifying-ai-alignment)
matters now -- and not only in in a few decades (or whenever we have enough computing power to match the human brain) -- 
there's a great series by Holden Karnofsky titled 
["The most important century"](https://www.cold-takes.com/roadmap-for-the-most-important-century-series/). There's also
a great 80,000 hours podcast episode: 
[#109 – Holden Karnofsky on the most important century](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/holden-karnofsky-most-important-century/).


The purpose of this blog is to serve as a reference for my future self. And hopefully, someone else will find something useful here.

Note: I also have another, deprecated blog where I used to write: [https://www.apoehlmann.com](https://www.apoehlmann.com)
