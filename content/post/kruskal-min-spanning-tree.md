### What is a minimum spanning tree?

According to Wikipedia [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree):

>A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_graph), 
> edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with 
> the minimum possible total edge weight. That is, it is a [spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree) 
> whose sum of edge weights is 
> as small as possible. More generally, any edge-weighted undirected graph (not necessarily connected) 
> has a minimum spanning forest, which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its [connected 
> components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory)).
