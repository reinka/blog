# Hello world!

After 3 years I decided to move my old blog [www.apoehlmann.com](www.apoehlmann.com)
to a new domain, based on a new tech stack: Go & GitOps. 

The result is this new website here. I wrote a couple more words on my old blog in the following post: 
[Time to Go](https://www.apoehlmann.com/blog/moving-new-domain-blog-andreipoehlmanndev/).

With that said, hello world!
