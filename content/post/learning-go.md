For a couple of weeks I have been learning Go and I found some resources of which 
I think they are quite good, so I want to share them here.

## [Learn Go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/): A practical approach to idiomatic Go

This was basically my main resource to get started with Go. 

For me, learning is most effective when I get to code something that goes beyond 
the minimal basics needed for the current topic / concept. The reason for that is
that I tend to overestimate how much I understood a new concept when it is presented
with only a simple example. Oftentimes I realize that only when I need to use that 
concept in a broader context and then suddenly code breaks, leaving behind that feeling of confusion 
that makes me deep digger into the technical details revealing how much I really
understood. For instance, [A tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/list) would be 
such a minimal tutorial.

The nice thing about *Learn Go with tests* is that it also teaches you Test Driven Development (TDD), so 
it also gives you a very nice introduction on how to write Go tests (and benchmarks!). This was an aspect of
the book I enjoyed most.

At the end you get to code your own web-server with a JSON API in a TDD way. So you have your application covered with
unit & integration tests from the ground up! 

## [Jon Bodner's: Learning Go](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go/9781492077206/)

This book was released only recently this year. Quoting from the book:

> This book is targeted at developers who are looking to pick up a second (or fifth) language.
> [...]
>The focus for *Learning Go* isn’t just how to write programs in Go; it’s how to write Go *idiomatically*. 
>More experienced Go developers can find advice on how to best use the newer features of the language. 
>The most important thing is that the reader wants to learn how to write Go code that looks like Go.

I stumbled on it because I was looking for a book that wasn't released 2+ years or so ago. Go is a rather young, 
quickly evolving programming language, so I wanted to make sure to find a book that's up-to-date as much as possible.
Besides that, its focus on how to write Go code idiomatically drew my attention.

## [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go)

This is another resource that gives tips on how to write idomatic Go code. It's online and for free. 


It might seem a little bit daunting at first, because it's rather long (don't look a the scroll bar). 
However, every "chapter" consists of several short "subchapters", like often really only a few, 
short paragraphs plus some code examples. So I set myself a really low goal: read at least one subchapter every day. 

This realistic goal helped me to read it consistently until I read it completely. And many times I read several
subchapters, which felt even more rewarding :P

## [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com): Keep practicing the basics with code challenges

I find it quite effective to solidify basics of a programming language, i.e. the most important data 
structures and built-ins, by solving algorithmic problems with that language, because it keeps you repeating the
fundamentals on a regular basis. 

I tried to do this daily the first couple of weeks, because that was when I learned most concepts in a short 
period of time, and I realized I would forget them too quickly if I don't use them on a daily basis.

It doesn't have to be leetcode. It could be any page that provides you such problems. Alternatives I know 
would be hackerrank or [project euler](https://projecteuler.net).
